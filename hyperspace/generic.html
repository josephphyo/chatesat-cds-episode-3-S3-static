							<p>Gunmanship: As a former Army veteran and the present Police Chief, Hopper is noteworthy for his experience with a variety of firearms, ranging from handguns, shotguns and .22 LRs to M16s and even an AK-47. While he mostly carried his revolver around with him during investigations and settling minor disputes, he was shown to be remarkably proficient in handling assault rifles and shotguns when he fought side by side with Eleven and protected her from the Demodogs by shooting a substantial number of them without much difficulty.</p>
							<p>Survival Instincts: Hopper's basic surviving skills helped him considerably when he was trapped in the tunnels corrupted by the Upside Down, such as, placing cigars for leaving a trail to follow, as well as crafting a makeshift torch from a branch.</p>
							<p>Craftsmanship: His military life led him to be familiarized with some crafting skills too, as displayed in "The Pollywog" when he constructed trip-wires around Eleven's location.</p>
							<p>Morse code: Hopper also had some knowledge regarding radio operation and its mechanisms, as he taught Eleven how to communicate over the radio using Morse code during their time together, as well as was very quick to infer the Morse Codes the then possessed Will was trying to signal.</p>
